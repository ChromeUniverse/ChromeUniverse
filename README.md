## Hi there! I'm Lucca, and this is my GitHub. 

My most relevant programming and electronics projects are right here. 

### A little bit about myself...

- I'm from BrasÃ­lia, Brazil. It's a nice place!
- I've completed my middle/high school edication at _ColÃ©gio Militar de BrasÃ­lia_.
- I've competed in several Math and Physics olympiads throughout middle/high school. 
- I'm a self-taught intermediate-level Python and C++ programmer.
- I play the alto sax ðŸŽ·, piano ðŸŽ¹ and electric bass ðŸŽ¸!
- Some of my favorite musicians (at the moment) are Cory Wong, Joe Dart, Herbie Hancock, Carlos Eiene, and Woody Goss.
- I plan on majoring in Electrical or Aerospace Engineering.

### A little bit about my personal projects...
- I love to code in Python! It's my favorite programming language.
- Most of my coding/electronics projects revolve around the idea of project-based learning. Often times, I'll find a really interesting concept in CS/electronics and learn it by implementing it in a specific project.
- I have a YouTube channel! I make videos about coding and hobbyist electronics. Check out [Lucca's Lab](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjpQ2w6Di2f-tyCiK6mVGlA)!
