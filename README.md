## Hi there! I'm Lucca, and this is my GitHub. 

My most relevant programming and electronics projects are right here. 

### A little bit about me:

- I love to code in Python! It's my favorite language.
- My favorite musician is lead rhythm funk guitarrist Cory Wong.
- I have a YouTube channel! Check out [Lucca's Lab](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjpQ2w6Di2f-tyCiK6mVGlA).
