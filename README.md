## Hi there! I'm Lucca, and this is my GitHub. 

My most relevant programming and electronics projects are right here. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **[RedstoneBot](https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/RedstoneBot/)** and **[my personal website](https://github.com/ChromeUniverse/Personal-website)**.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **JavaScript/Node.js**, **basic full-stack web development** and **basic CI/CD with GitHub Actions**.
- 📫 Reach out to me on Discord! **Lucca#2744**
- 🖥 Consider checking out **[my blog](http://34.200.98.64:3000/)**! While it might not look like much, I've put a lot of effort into making it.

### A little bit about myself...

- I'm from Brasília, Brazil. It's a nice place!
- I've completed my middle/high school education at _Colégio Militar de Brasília_ - I graduated in December 2020.
- I've competed in several Math and Physics olympiads throughout middle/high school. 
- I'm a self-taught intermediate-level Python/C++ and an "advanced beginner" JS programmer.
- I plan on majoring in Electrical or Aerospace Engineering.
- I'm a musician too! I play the alto and tenor sax 🎷, piano/keyboard 🎹 and electric bass 🎸.

### A little bit about my personal projects...
- 🐍 I love Python! It's my favorite programming language.
- Most of my coding/electronics projects revolve around the idea of "learning by doing". Often times, I'll find a really interesting concept in CS/electronics and learn more about it by implementing it in a specific project.   
- I have a small YouTube channel! I make videos about coding and hobbyist electronics. Check out [Lucca's Lab](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjpQ2w6Di2f-tyCiK6mVGlA)!
